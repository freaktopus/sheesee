# Sheesee

## Workflow
Any resolution image is converted to a 400*300 resolution image -> image processing (convolution) -> send computed pixels to google sheets via its api

## What I imagine can be done
1. Live cam broatcast in a sheet
2. Vizualization of Sheesee in animated form (batch-wise rendering - animation illusion )
3. Solar system animation in sheet
