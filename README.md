# Sheesee

## Workflow
A 400*400 resolution image -> image processing (convolution) -> send computed pixels to google sheets via its api

## What I imagine can be done
1. Live cam broatcast in a sheet
2. Vizualization of Sheesee in animated form (batch-wise rendering - animation illusion )
3. Solar system animation in sheet
4. CLI to take any resolution image and convert to 400*400 resolution and then only compute for convolution
